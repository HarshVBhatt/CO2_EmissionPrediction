Final inferences:

1. Majority of the cars have 4 cylinders(43%), followed by 6 cylinders(33%) and 8 cylinders(18%)
2. These cars account for 94.7% of total CO2 Emissions
3. Emission increases as number of cylinders increase
4. Bugatti cars have the highest average emission
5. Vans (Cargo and Passenger) have the highest average emission
6. AM5 engines have relatively lowest average emission
7. E > Z > D > X > N fuel type emission rate
8. CO2 Emission(g/km) is dependent on Engine Size(L), Fuel Consumption City(L/100km), Fuel Consumption Comb(mpg)
9. Features like Make, Vehicle Class, Transmission, Fuel Type do not provide significant value towards the prediction of CO2 Emission(g/km)
10. CO2 Emission(g/km) increases with the increase in Engine Size(L)
11. CO2 Emission(g/km) increases with the increase in Fuel Consumption City(L/100km)
12. CO2 Emission(g/km) decreases with the increase in Fuel Consumption Comb(mpg)

Fuel Consumption Comb(mpg) has the most influence on Emission(-ve correlation), followed by Fuel Consumption City(L/100km)(+ve correlation) and lastly Engine Size(L)(+ve correlation)
